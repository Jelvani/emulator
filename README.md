You can use this virtual machine as an entry into learning assembly, or even model your own virtual machine after this for educational purposes. 


## Installation

To get started simply clone this repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Jelvani/virtualMachine
```

## Usage

To get started, navigate to the directory of the reposity in Linux and run:
```sh
make
```
Now that the code is compiled, you can run the sample fibonnacci program that comes with the repository.
First you must use the assembler to generate the machine code that is to be run:
```sh
./assembler fibonacci.txt
```

This will produce a file called `output.txt`

This file contains the machine code generated by the assembler. We can now have the virtuala machine run this program by calling:
```sh
./vm output.txt
```
You should see an output containing the state of each register after the execution of each intruction.
