You can use this virtual machine as an entry into learning assembly, or even model your own virtual machine after this for educational purposes. 


## Installation

To get started simply clone this repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Jelvani/virtualMachine
```

## Usage

To get started, navigate to the directory of the reposity in Linux and run:
```sh
make
```
Now that the code is compiled, you can run the sample fibonnacci program that comes with the repository.
First you must use the assembler to generate the machine code that is to be run:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Jelvani/virtualMachine
```

_For more examples and usage, please refer to the [Wiki][wiki]._

## Development setup

Describe how to install all development dependencies and how to run an automated test-suite of some kind. Potentially do this for multiple platforms.

```sh
make install
npm test
```
